##JPA CRUD Project
### Week 9 Skill Distillery Homework Project

#### Overview
This is a full stack java program for accessing and retrieving pandemic data from a mysql database. The program connects to a MySQL database through JPA so the user can Create, Read, Update and Delete data.
The program utilizes the HTML to display text to the user and take keyboard input.

The program uses both a Spring boot project and a JPA project for managing and persiting data from the mysql database. There is the app class as usual as well as a object class for mapping pandemics. There is an data access obect interface and implementing class for accessing the MySQL database.

#### How to Run
1. Launch the Java application and access it through a web browser.
2. The program will display to the user a search field from which they can search pandemics by ID. They will aslo be displayed a list of all pandemics and a button to add a new pandemic.
3. The user may select or search pandemics by ID from which they will be brought to that pandemics page if it exists. From there they will see detailed information and options to update or delete the pandemic.
4. Should the user choose to add or update a pandemic they will be brought to a form from which they can add/edit information and then submit it to the database. They will see a confirmation and the updated information should they do so.

#### Lessons Learned
The amount i have learned from this project is almost too much to express. I feel like I finally understand the flow of data between my program, the web, and my database. There are so many more features and improvements that I still want to add to this project that I am sure I will be updateing it for a while.
